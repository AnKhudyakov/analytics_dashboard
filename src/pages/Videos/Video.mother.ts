        description:
          'oops! she did it again!\n#M3GAN2 is only in theaters June 27. \n\n---\nWebsite: http://www.M3GANmovie.com\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/universalpictures  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/meetM3GAN/\nX: https://twitter.com/meetm3gan\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/M3GAN/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/m3gan\n\n\nThe murderous doll who captivated pop culture in 2023 is back. And this time she‚Äôs not alone. \n\nThe original creative team behind that phenomenon‚Äîled by horror titans James Wan for Atomic Monster, Jason Blum for Blumhouse and writer-director Gerard Johnstone‚Äîreboot an all-new wild chapter in A.I. mayhem with M3GAN 2.0. Two years after M3GAN, a marvel of artificial intelligence, went rogue and embarked on\na murderous (and impeccably choreographed) rampage and was subsequently\ndestroyed, M3GAN‚Äôs creator Gemma (Allison Williams) has become a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of A.I. Meanwhile, Gemma‚Äôs niece Cady (Violet McGraw), now 14, has become a teenager, rebelling against Gemma‚Äôs overprotective rules.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, the underlying tech for M3GAN has been stolen and misused by a powerful defense contractor to create a military-grade weapon known as Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno; Ahsoka, Pacific Rim: Uprising), the ultimate killer infiltration spy. But as Amelia‚Äôs self-awareness increases, she becomes decidedly less interested in taking orders from humans. Or in keeping them around. \n\nWith the future of human existence on the line, Gemma realizes that the only option is to resurrect M3GAN (Amie Donald, voiced by Jenna Davis) and give her a few upgrades, making her faster, stronger, and more lethal. As their paths collide, the original A.I icon is about to meet her match.\n\nM3GAN 2.0 is written and directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Gerard Johnstone, from a story by Gerard Johnstone and Akela Cooper, based on characters created by Akela Cooper & James Wan.\n\nThe film co-stars returning cast members Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps as Gemma‚Äôs loyal tech teammates, Cole and Tess, and new characters played by Aristotle Athari (Saturday Night Live, Hacks), Timm Sharp (Apples Never Fall, Percy Jackson and the Olympians) and Grammy winner and 11-time Emmy nominee Jemaine Clement (Avatar: The Way of Water, What We Do in the Shadows). \n\nProduced by James Wan, Jason Blum and Allison Williams, the film is executive produced by Gerard Johnstone, Adam Hendricks, Greg Gilreath, Michael Clear, Judson Scott and Mark D. Katchur. \n\nThe first M3GAN film shattered box office records, opening to $30.4 million domestically to become the biggest opening weekend for a PG-13 horror film since A Quiet Place Part II. The film went on to gross more than $180 million worldwide.',

          description:
            'oops! she did it again!\n#M3GAN2 is only in theaters June 27. \n\n---\nWebsite: http://www.M3GANmovie.com\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/universalpictures  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/meetM3GAN/\nX: https://twitter.com/meetm3gan\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/M3GAN/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/m3gan\n\n\nThe murderous doll who captivated pop culture in 2023 is back. And this time she‚Äôs not alone. \n\nThe original creative team behind that phenomenon‚Äîled by horror titans James Wan for Atomic Monster, Jason Blum for Blumhouse and writer-director Gerard Johnstone‚Äîreboot an all-new wild chapter in A.I. mayhem with M3GAN 2.0. Two years after M3GAN, a marvel of artificial intelligence, went rogue and embarked on\na murderous (and impeccably choreographed) rampage and was subsequently\ndestroyed, M3GAN‚Äôs creator Gemma (Allison Williams) has become a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of A.I. Meanwhile, Gemma‚Äôs niece Cady (Violet McGraw), now 14, has become a teenager, rebelling against Gemma‚Äôs overprotective rules.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, the underlying tech for M3GAN has been stolen and misused by a powerful defense contractor to create a military-grade weapon known as Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno; Ahsoka, Pacific Rim: Uprising), the ultimate killer infiltration spy. But as Amelia‚Äôs self-awareness increases, she becomes decidedly less interested in taking orders from humans. Or in keeping them around. \n\nWith the future of human existence on the line, Gemma realizes that the only option is to resurrect M3GAN (Amie Donald, voiced by Jenna Davis) and give her a few upgrades, making her faster, stronger, and more lethal. As their paths collide, the original A.I icon is about to meet her match.\n\nM3GAN 2.0 is written and directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Gerard Johnstone, from a story by Gerard Johnstone and Akela Cooper, based on characters created by Akela Cooper & James Wan.\n\nThe film co-stars returning cast members Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps as Gemma‚Äôs loyal tech teammates, Cole and Tess, and new characters played by Aristotle Athari (Saturday Night Live, Hacks), Timm Sharp (Apples Never Fall, Percy Jackson and the Olympians) and Grammy winner and 11-time Emmy nominee Jemaine Clement (Avatar: The Way of Water, What We Do in the Shadows). \n\nProduced by James Wan, Jason Blum and Allison Williams, the film is executive produced by Gerard Johnstone, Adam Hendricks, Greg Gilreath, Michael Clear, Judson Scott and Mark D. Katchur. \n\nThe first M3GAN film shattered box office records, opening to $30.4 million domestically to become the biggest opening weekend for a PG-13 horror film since A Quiet Place Part II. The film went on to gross more than $180 million worldwide.',
